In this article we will consider representation of information about chemical interactions - from the point of view of graph theory. We will expose some properties of chemical reactions graph in order to infer types of chemical compounds, and do this in polynomial time. And, finally, I would like to provide detailed description of developed programming framework for approximate inference over pairwise Markov Random Fields, with such examples as: decoding of Low-density parity-check codes, Coloring of graph, Fraud detection using network effects.
